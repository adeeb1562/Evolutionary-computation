# Predicting Income class from Census Data using Grammatical Evolution

Implemented a predictive model to determine whether an individual's income exceeds $50K/yr based on census data. Leveraged Grammatical Evolution (GE) technique over Genetic Programming for its flexibility and efficiency. Utilized Python libraries including GRAPE for GE implementation and pandas for data preprocessing. Applied one-hot encoding to handle categorical variables and transposed data for compatibility with GE fitness function. Implemented GE algorithm for evolutionary optimization, refining candidate programs through genetic operators. Achieved a best fitness of 0.21634 with a depth of 43 and genome length of 725. Submitted predictions on Kaggle for evaluation.
